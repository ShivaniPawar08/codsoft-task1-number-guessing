Description of the Task 1:Number Guessing Game

This project was developed as Task 1 during my internship at CodSoft from 10 January to 10 February.

The goal of this task was to build a simple console-based Java application where the computer randomly selects a number and the user attempts to guess it. The program provides feedback after each guess, helping the player reach the correct answer.
